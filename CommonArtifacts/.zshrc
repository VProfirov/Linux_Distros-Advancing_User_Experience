###### SOURCES (last one overrides previous) (#imporant!):

############################## OH-MY-ZSH(zsh framework) SOURCING: 01st load =>
source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh

# All of the above variables are zsh-default and are oh-my-zsh compatible.
# That being said, with the export ZSH=~/.oh-my-zsh/
# all fallowing "default" behavior is furder modified bt the oh-my-zsh init script
# Including the section with the plugin listing: plugin = {...}

# NB! here the sourcing is of oh-my-zsh is done last, compared to the zplug's
# sourcing, below. Zplug has a "zplug load" section after it's init.

############################## ZPLUG(zsh package manager) SOURCING: 02rd load =>
# NOTE: 
# 1. zplug has a SAMPLE .zshrc showing zplug addons which we add here
# direclty
# 2. zplug uses .zplug/packages.zsh to load/manage and monitor packages installed
#    through ZPLUG and internaly. The ones below (zplug-doctor, etc..)
#    are loaded externaly-to-zplug, but still managed by it
# 3. These packages are located in .zplug/cache

# The backbone of zplug =>
source $ZPLUG/init.zsh

########################## ALIASES
#
# Set personal aliases, overriding those provided by oh-my-zsh libs,
# plugins, and themes. Aliases can be placed here, though oh-my-zsh
# users are encouraged to define aliases within the ZSH_CUSTOM folder.
# For a full list of active aliases, run `alias`.
#
# Example aliases
# alias zshconfig="mate ~/.zshrc"
# alias ohmyzsh="mate ~/.oh-my-zsh"
#
# vi alias - work-around for the sudo='sudo '(sudo-alias loading)  { What is the order of alias related file loading?}
# unalias vi
# unalias vim
## ORIGINAL SOLUTION for unalias-ing vim
[ "$(type -w vi)" = 'vi: alias' ] && unalias vi
[ "$(type -w vim)" = 'vim: alias' ] && unalias vim
[ "$(type -w mc)" = 'mc: alias' ] && unalias mc
